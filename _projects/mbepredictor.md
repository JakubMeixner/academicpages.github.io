## Project Summary

This tool combines convolutional and recurrent neural networks to estimate the roughness of surfaces during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth in real time. Used for anomaly detection and process control.

### Features

- CNN-based frame encoding
- LSTM for time-series prediction
- Compatible with live RHEED data
